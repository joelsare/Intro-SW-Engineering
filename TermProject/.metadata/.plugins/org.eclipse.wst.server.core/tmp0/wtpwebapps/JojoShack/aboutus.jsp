<H1>About Us</H1>
 	
 	<p>
 	We at Jojo Shack created this website because we believe that 
 	volunteering is one of the best ways to give back to your community. 
 	Because of volunteering, both volunteers and people that are 
 	being helped benefit. It's always nice to give back to those 
 	who are less fortunate, and we want to make that easier than ever.
 	 We believe that we can take this problem of volunteering and make 
 	it simpler to navigate with this website.
